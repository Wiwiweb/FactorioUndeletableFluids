Version: 1.0.4
Date: ????
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some fluids disappearing when trying to flush a fluid in a system that had multiple fluids.
    - Fixed destroying a fluid (with "Prevent destruction" setting) not preserving temperature.

  Info:
    - KNOWN BUG: Attempting to flush fluids will reset the fluid to its default temperature. Be careful around steam!
      The fix for this bug will require an API change: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=109233

Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2023-09-18
  Changes:
    - Added "deletable fluids" remote interface methods: `get/set/add/remove_deletable_fluid`. This can be used instead of the "undeletable" list by mods who want to restrict all fluids except a few. The "undeletable" list will be ignored if the "deletable" list is used.

Date: 2023-03-11

  Changes:
